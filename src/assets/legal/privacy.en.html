    or if another legal basis permits the disclosure of data. When using

    GDPR).</p>
<p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME
    OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING
    ; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING, INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF

        request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
    <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you may
